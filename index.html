          Hi, I am a <b>software developer</b> who likes to create games in his spare time. Of course I also like
          <b>mead</b>.
          And green tea.

        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I am working as a developer for about five years now. I like minimalism and the love for the detail.</p>
        <p>
          Currently I am working on two projects: a version of <b>Fanorona</b> and a <b>card game with battling
            monsters</b>.
          Besides that there are way too many ideas in my head and there are way too many unfinished projects
          somewhere in my file system.
        </p>
        <p>
          I prefer <b>JavaScript</b> and <b>C#</b> for coding at the moment but am always trying out new stuff.
