        Hi, I am a <b>software developer</b> who likes to create games in his spare time. Of course I also like
        <b>mead</b>.
        And green tea.
      </div>
      <p>
        Currently I am working on two projects: a version of <b>Fanorona</b> and a <b>card game with battling
          monsters</b>.
        Besides that there are way too many ideas in my head and there are way too many unfinished projects
        somewhere in my file system.
      </p>
      <p>
        I prefer <b>JavaScript</b> and <b>C#</b> for coding at the moment but am always trying out new stuff.
      </p>
      <i>On this page I want to put some information about me and my projects.
        It gets updated as soon as I have finished my first public game!</i>
